# notes

- values are shown as boxes?
- operators are just template boxes with lines? input/output that carries boxes around?
- how would multiple inputs work, multiple outputs?
- what about looping, if/else, debugging, logging?
- parameterize operators?
- what about this as a tower defense game where the monsters are just inputs, need to turn inputs into certain values?
- how does this relate to music, changing keys/scales?
- [x] animate operator box lines to show flow of boxes
  - length user-made, or lengthens based on complexity?
- input area should also move if hovered over?
- `+1` operator as it's own box, what if it had it's own canvas (like a google maps type zoom in and out), or like stack trace debugger that can freeze when going in and out of these boxes
