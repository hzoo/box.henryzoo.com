# notes

- values are shown as boxes?
- operators are just template boxes with lines? input/output that carries boxes around?
- how would multiple inputs work, multiple outputs?
- what about looping, if/else, debugging, logging?
- parameterize operators?
- what about this as a tower defense game where the monsters are just inputs, need to turn inputs into certain values?
- how does this relate to music, changing keys/scales?
